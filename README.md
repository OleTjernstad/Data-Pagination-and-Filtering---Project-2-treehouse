# Data Pagination and Filtering - Project 2 treehouse

## Project steps

- [] Display a “page”
  - Create a function that will show a “page” of nine students.
    This function should have two parameters:
    A list parameter to represent student data that will be passed as an argument when the function is called.
    A page parameter to represent the page number that will be passed as an argument when the function is called.
    Inside the function:

  - Create two variables to store the start index and the end index of the list items to be displayed on the given page. 
  - Select the UL element with a class of student-list and assign its value to a variable.

  - Write a conditional statement that checks if the current index (i) is greater than or equal to the start index variable and less than the end index variable.
